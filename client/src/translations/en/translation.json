        "description": "Spare connects people in need of clothing and other essentials with people in the community who have things to spare. It is like a one-on-one Goodwill. The main objective is to foster interactions between the housed and unhoused.We are hoping the donation can be a mechanism for building these connections throughout our community.",

        "howItWorkBody": "There are two main pages, a donation page and a request page. If you want to donate, the donation page houses each request that comes in, and you can fulfill a specific request from there. If youâ€™d like to request an item, the request page has categories you can fill out a short form to request. Once there is a match both the requester and donator will receive an email and text on when to pick-up/drop-off the item at the designated donation facility. These locations are well known established donation facilities, already in use for general donations.",
