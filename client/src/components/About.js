      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Spare connects people in need of clothing and other essentials with people in the community who have things to spare.
        It is like a one-on-one Goodwill. The main objective is to foster interactions between the housed and unhoused.
        We are hoping the donation can be a mechanism for building these connections throughout our community.
      </p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
        There are two main pages, a donation page and a request page. If you want to donate, the donation page houses each request that comes in, and you can fulfill a specific request from there.
        If youâ€™d like to request an item, the request page has categories you can fill out a short form to request. Once there is a match both the requester and donator will receive an email and text on when to pick-up/drop-off the item at the designated donation facility.
        These locations are well known established donation facilities, already in use for general donations.
      </p>
      <h3>The team</h3>
